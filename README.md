# Deploy an Article CMS to Azure 

<i>Cloud Developer using Microsoft Azure Nanodegree Program</i>

<p>A simple Content Management System (CMS) for articles, where a user can log in, view published articles, and publish new articles. </p>
 
## My Udacity Project (Azure Applications) Overview

In this project, I was given a simple Content Management System (CMS) for articles, where a user can log in, view published articles, and publish new articles. An article consists of a title, author, and body of text (to be stored in an Azure SQL Server) along with an image (to be stored in Azure Blob Storage).

The CMS includes the following components:

* A webapp using Python with the Flask framework.
* A SQL database that contains a user table and an article table for the webapp to query.
* A Blob Storage container where images are stored.

I had to create and manage the resources necessary to fully deploy both the necessary storage and compute resources for the app to Azure. As part of the project, I also needed to analyze which resource best fits for app deployment between a VM or App Service. Lastly, I added in an authentication option to Sign in with Microsoft, as well as logging for successful and unsuccessful logins.
